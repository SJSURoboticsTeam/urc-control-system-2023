NOTE: This is how you setup a project for the first time after installing 
When you reach "Cloning the target libraries" in libhal do the following:
    run:
        git clone https://github.com/libhal/liblpc40xx
        cd liblpc40xx/demos
        mkdir build
        cd build
        conan install .. -s build_type=Debug
Then depending on your operating system do the following:
    WSL:
        cd ..
        run ./build_debug_wsl.sh
    Windows:
        cd ..
        run ./build_debug_windows.sh
    Linux:
        cd ..
        run chmod +x build_debug_wsl.sh
    MacOS:
        TBD
The previous will run a bash script which will build and compile your project for you and if it doesn't work, then open the .sh
file and run each command on your own.

Flashing:
    This is relatively simple, do the following:
        If you haven't downloaded nxpprog already run: 
            pip3 install nxpprog
        Then use the following command but goto the build file and run ls, then look for the binary file you are trying to flash, replace lpc4078_uart.bin with the binary file name then goto https://libhal.github.io/web-serial/ and click connect when you have your dev-2 board plugged in, here you will be able to click connect, scroll all the way down and find what COM0X port the de-2 is connected to, switch the /dev/tty.usbserial-140 in the following command to that port and run the commmand:
            nxpprog --control --binary="lpc4078_app.bin " --device="COM5"
        
After this you are all set to continue flashing and building using the previous instructions.
If you are in windows and see a lot of printouts with a final statement of 'force_update', this is expected an your code still flashed it is a current bug being worked on.

Use the following link to find the different libaries that are supported:
    https://libhal.jfrog.io/ui/packages?name=lib&type=packages

If you want to include another library in the project you copy and past a library name then / then the version number into the conanfile.txt like the following for the rmd library (put it under requires):
    librmd/0.3.2
