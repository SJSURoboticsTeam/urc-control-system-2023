  /**
   * @brief Get the command object
   *
   * This command is infallible and will always return a command.
   * If mission control is disconnected from the machine, this command will
   * return the last known value. The heartbeat_count can be used to indicate
   * when the connection has been re-established.
   *
   * It is the responsibility of this driver to re-establishing the connection.
   * This driver is allowed to utilize time during this call in order to
   * reestablish the connection.
   *
   * The timeout is used to break out of the function. This is useful, because
   * attempting to reestablish a connection to mission control could take a
   * considerable amount of time and thus, could stall out the application.
   *
   * @param p_timeout - the amount of time to either get the latest command or
   * attempt to reestablish a connection to mission control.
   * @return drive_commands - the last known driver command received. If no
   * commands have been received, then this should return the default
   * initialized command.
